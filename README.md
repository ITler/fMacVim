fMacVim 
=======

== Introduction

Briefly, I don't see this as another collection of dotfiles, but a selection of
the best plugins and configs for those willing to enjoy the power of Vim on
their Mac.

**Simple**. I tried to have this in mind while I was building this "package".

Somehow I was inspired by [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles), but I did
not wanted to have such a big package, I wanted to keep way simpler. I packed it
based on my own preferences, but I'm sharing it because someone may be
interested on my approach :)


== Installation

I provide you with tho options

=== 1) Easiest install: Drag and drop

I took MacVim, included all plugins and configs for you to Drag and Drop it into
your Applications directory.  

[Download](https://github.com/fbeeper/fMacVim)

=== 2) Easy install: Bash script

Another option is to clone this repo and execute the install script

``` git clone http://github.com/fbeeper/fMacVim.vim ./fvim.sh ``` 

Besides the oportunity of recustomization, this installation includes terminal
support for the customized Vim.


== Details details details!

* The best .vimrc I've been able to create. Even though I didn't kept it
  minimal, I've made an effort to organize and comment everything. You should
  take a look at it!

== What's the future of fMacVim?

This is nowhere near to be perfect, so I expect to bring future updates.

* I should build .vimrc and .gvimrc separatedly to avoid having some warnings
  I'm getting right now :S
* I should consider splitting the .vimrc to make it easier to mantain
